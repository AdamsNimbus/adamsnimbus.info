    "summary": "Having exposure to a variety of IT technologies is one thing, knowing how to leverage them to drive a business forward is another. My analysis is not stuck simply to the software stack, but to technology as a whole which can lead to drastic resource/time savings. I Have strong exposure in the Finance sector, specifically Banking, Government Treasury, Insurance and more recently Consulting on Cloud transitions for Airlines, Gas/Power companies and other large financial orgs. I feel the experience I have gained is strongly applicable to IT roles that focus on the following:\n\nDriving automation\n\n- A keen sense in detecting workflows that drain resources, slow down overnight processing runs or tasks that are asking to be automated. \n- Migrating complex jobs, splitting up and leveraging cloud technologies such as event driven serverless or containerised scaling solutions. \n\nCloud transitions\n\n- Exposed to the considerations of resourcing, security, performance and automation that projects under Amazon Cloud (AWS) & Google Cloud (GCP)  architecture can bring.\n- Design, deployment and support of AWS environments with focus on Immutable Infrastructure as Code solutions rather than classical mode 1 deployments, leveraging leading industry tooling.\n- Live application troubleshooting providing technical assistance to development teams.\n- Extensive application migration experience for a number of clients - Rehost, Replatform & Refactor. \n\nProject driven results\n\n- Recognised as a strong technical communicator with the ability to form strong bonds with non IT sections of the business and absorb the big picture and fill in the gaps to reach milestones.\n- Strong agile mindset, able to efficiently utilise own time as well as others by running to the point workshops to deliver team based outcomes.\n- Pivotal member of a project team involved in a six month critical data centre move with role including vendor relations, business continuity as well as all technical aspects of the move.
